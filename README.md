## Django Recipes

### Problem

When Family move out of home, they may to take the family recipe book with them.
Either:
 * Due to all the recipes have been commited to memory by relatives.
 * The recipes are out dated, ( have been mentally updated, but not put to paper).
 * The recipes are just a collections of sheets of paper.
 

### Solution

Have a web based Recipe book, where all family members are able to access.
Either via self hosting, or public server with access restriction.
Accessible to all devices, including laptops ( so you can edit recipes at your leasure).


### So far

I have already built a version of this as a PHP Symfony Project.
But have been after a bit more of a challange, learn a new language,
and use something that isn't PHP.
In building this in PHP I have worked out what does and does not work.

### TODO

 * Front ability to add and edit recipes
 * Image upload
 * Search in navbar (design)
 * Themes?
 * Allow external use (externmal links to recipes, with no authentication)
 * Side by side view for recipes (This was requested)
